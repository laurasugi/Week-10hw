					It's important for developers to use RWD in their web pages because of the advances in the world of technology. There are now many different devices capable of web browsing, and with that comes many different screen sizes.  It's important to be able to create web sites in which your content is displayed in the way you intended it to be, no matter what device it is being viewed on.
					<br><br>
					RWD also saves developers time, by allowing you to develop one site capable of adjusting itself instead of multiple different device specific sites.
