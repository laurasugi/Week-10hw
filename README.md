# Summary
This week I didn't really add any extra content to my website, as I wanted to really focus on getting the formatting correct and keeping my code cleaner than last weeks assignment.
I think that this paid off as I had a much easier time finding and fixing errors in my code than I have in the past.  This project ended up being one of the first ones that I got through with no major disasters or frusturation and I really enjoyed it!

# Wireframing
The wireframing process was very helpful to me this week. It really helped me get organized before I started writing the code and really helped me with structuring my page.

The wireframing process also helped me to have a very clear idea of what I was going to do, instead of me getting halfway through and realizing that I needed to change something.

# Issues
The only issue I had this week was with the middle two boxes.  When I was sizing the page down, they were jumping around and white space was showing at the bottom of one of them.  I fixed this by setting the height for both of the boxes to 'height="auto"' on my style sheet.
